3. Inside the `forms/` folder, create a new folder following this pattern:

4. Add your HTML form as `index.html` inside your folder. You can also add a `style.css` if you want to style your form.  
5. Save your changes and commit them with a clear message, for example:  
   *Added Sakshi Login Form*  
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
